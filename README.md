## Project Description
The Korean wave refers to the global popularity of South Korea's cultural economy exporting pop culture, 
entertainment, music, TV dramas and movies. Netflix has been riding on this wave too as over the past few years, 
the streaming service inked a deal with Korean production companies to create more original shows and movies. 
Using this dataset, we want to have a better understanding of what Korean content is available on Nextflix France.
